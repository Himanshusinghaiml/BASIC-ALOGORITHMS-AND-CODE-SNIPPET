Polymorphism in object-oriented programming can be categorized into two main types: compile-time polymorphism (also known as static polymorphism or method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic polymorphism or method overriding).

Compile-Time Polymorphism:

Definition: Compile-time polymorphism occurs when the method that needs to be executed is determined at compile time.

Mechanism: It is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.

Resolution: The appropriate method to be executed is determined by the number and types of arguments provided during the method call at compile time.

Example:

python
Copy code
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def add(self, a, b, c):
        return a + b + c
In the above example, the compiler determines which add method to call based on the number and types of arguments provided.

Runtime Polymorphism:

Definition: Runtime polymorphism occurs when the method that needs to be executed is determined at runtime.

Mechanism: It is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

Resolution: The method to be executed is determined by the actual type of the object at runtime.

Example:

python
Copy code
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"
In the above example, the speak method of an object is
resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the object.

In Python, method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) is limited compared to some other 
languages like Java or C++. Python supports a form of polymorphism known as duck typing, 
where the behavior of an object is
determined by its attributes and methods, rather than its explicit type. Method overriding 
(runtime polymorphism) is a common feature in Python, and 
it allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass.
